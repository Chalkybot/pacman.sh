        <h3>Hello, I am Ben.</h2>
        <p>Very simple and straight to the point, eh? I've never written an "about me" page before, so this might be blunt or boring.</p>
        <p>I'm a computer science student interested at working as a systems administrator in the future. I've got an interest in cybersecurity, but I'm undecided on whether I'll pursue it as a career path. I'm familiar with most "skid" tools and a lot of the jargon, although I lack real world experience.</p>
        <p>Most of my interests hover around computers, though I'm very keen on diving, specifically diving distances is very fun. It's great exercise and it has a very direct number that I can track to see my performance increase or decrease.</p>
        <p>Another interest I have which is similar on some level is geocaching. I like 'adventuring' and looking for things, geocaching combines these two things very well. It's even more fun to do in forests or other places in nature.</p>
        <p>I wrote this site as I saw some cool websites on <i>a certain retro aesthethic webring</i>. Prior to creating this website, I had no knowledge of CSS or HTML. Well, let's be honest here, I still have no knowledge of either. 
        Graphic design is not my passion as is evident. I like things to be simple to use.</p>
