        <h3>Hello, I am Ben.</h2>
        <p>Very simple and straight to the point, eh? I've never written an "about me" page before.</p>
        <p>I studying Computer Science at the University of Helsinki, I'm interested in System Architecture and in general, understanding how systems work on a deeper level. I'm a big *nix person, but lately, I've hovered move over Windows in terms of software development.</p>
        <p>For as long as I can remember, I've been into computers and specifically making things. I started with Python 2.* in elementary school, but migrated away from that to C# and C++ in middle school. I've now been mainly using Rust, Python and Bash for the past few years. I'm definitely into Rust for software development, but I find Python and Bash useful for when I need to have a minimum viable product as quick as possible.</p>
        <p>I've in some CTFs and competed some amount of the general 'hacking' sites, <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">tryhackme.com</a>, <a href="https://hackthissite.org">hackthissite</a> and the lot. Doing CTFs is fun, but I much more enjoy reading technical information, and then attempting to break or otherwise create malicious software with that information. I'm sure this somehow ties to the empty boat, but I'm none the wiser.</p>
        <p> In my free time, aside from computer stuff, I read books. Most recent books have been an <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ansible-up-and/9781098109141/">O'Reilly book on Ansible</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/resources/windows-internals/">Windows Internals</a>. I highly recommend Windows Internals if you're interested in system architecture, or just understanding how Windows works. Aside from reading, I like to exercising and swimming. I'm also a big fan of diving distances, although this wraps in with swimming. It's a nice hobby as I have an integer I can follow to see if I've improved or gotten worse. Metrics for the win!</p>
