        <p>I've been getting back into programming after taking a long break. The last time I did "serious" programming was around 3-4 years ago. Back then, I had no proper aim for I wanted to do and just made things for the sake of creating. Now, I've got real aims for what I create and don't have infinite awful feature creep which is nice.</p>
        <p> My recent projects worth mentioning, aside from this "retro" website include a script to sync Spotify data with VRChat and a protonDB commandline interface.
        <p> I'll add more stuff here once I've got more time.</p>
